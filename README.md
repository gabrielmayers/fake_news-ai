Detecting Fake News using Neural Networks 😡

## How These Works:

Basically, I builded a Neural Network using LSTM's layers to predict, based on titles of news, what's **fake news** and what's not!

## Data Source:

I took the data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), you can access the data [here](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset).

## Predictions:

The **predictions** are based only in the title of news!
